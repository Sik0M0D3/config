IMPORTANT BAR AND SCRIPTS THEMES INFO:
All of the scripts that have color variables are: "sb-clock", "sb-network", "sb-volume" and "waldl".
They all require a symlink to a theme in "bar_themes/" so that they can reference a specific color's value.
You can choose to make your own themes or use the default ones that i have in this repo (it doesn't matter).

TO MAKE A SYMBOLIC-LINK FILE:
Use the "ln" command like this e.g:
  "ln -s bar_themes/'x_theme' file_name"  <-  this "file_name" is where you define the name of the symlink.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SYMLINK:
All of the scripts before mentioned reference the file with the name "cur_theme" at their beginning:
  "[ -r ~/.local/bin/cur_theme ] && . ~/.local/bin/cur_theme" || exit   <-  THIS LINE!!!

The exit CMD at the EotL is to exit the script(s) if "cur_theme" isn't found or isn't readable.
So don't run dwmblocks if you remove the exit CMD and don't have a symlink because dwm's bar will get bugged
and you'll have to quit or reset dwm and run it without running dwmblocks.

So if you want to use another name for the symlink you can :D but you'll have to edit all of the scripts D:
to match that particular name instead of "cur_theme" or else the scripts WILL NOT RUN!!!

I do this to easily change the themes of all scripts by only deleting the current symlink and
creating another one with the same name pointing to a different theme in "bar_themes/".

Symlink and CMD e.g:
  "ln -s  bar_themes/nord  cur_theme" <- This CMD will give you a symlink that points to -> "bar_themes/nord".
