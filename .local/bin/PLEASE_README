BAR AND SCRIPTS THEME:

All the scripts that have color variables are: sb-clock, sb-network, sb-volume and waldl.
They all require a symlink to a theme in "bar_themes/" so that they can reference a specific color.
You can choose to make your own theme file or use the default ones that i have in this repo it doesn't matter.

Use the "ln" command to make a symlink like this e.g:
  "ln -s bar_themes/'x_theme' file_name"  <-  this "file_name" is where you define the name of the symlink.

All of the scripts before mentioned reference the file with the name "cur_theme" at their beginning:
  "[ -r ~/.local/bin/cur_theme ] && . ~/.local/bin/cur_theme" || exit <- this line.
  The exit at the end of line is to exit the script(s) if "cur_theme" isn't found or if it's unreadable.

So if you want to use another name for the symlink you can :D but you'll have to edit all of the scripts D:
to match that particular name instead "cur_theme" or else the scripts WILL NOT RUN!!!

I do this to easily change the themes of all scripts by only deleting the current symlink and
creating another one with the same name pointing to a different theme in "bar_themes/".

Symlink and CMD e.g:
  "ln -s  bar_themes/nord  cur_theme" <- This will give you a symlink that points to "bar_themes/nord".
