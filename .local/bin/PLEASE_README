WITHOUT A SYMLINK WITH THE NAME "cur_theme" POINTING TO A THEME DMWBLOCKS WILL CRASH DWM!!!

IMPORTANT BAR AND SCRIPTS THEMES INFO:
All of the scripts that have color variables are: "sb-clock", "sb-network", "sb-volume" and "waldl".
They all require a symlink to a theme in "bar_themes/" so that they can reference a specific color's value.
You can choose to make your own themes or use the default ones that i have in this repo (it doesn't matter).

TO CREATE A SYMBOLIC-LINK:
Use the "ln" command like this e.g:
  "ln -s bar_themes/'x_theme' file_name"  <-  this "file_name" is where you define the name of the symlink.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SYMLINK:
All of the scripts before mentioned won't be able of running because they all reference in a line the file
with the name "cur_theme" (i.e. the symlink) at their beginning:
                      "Here ↓ "                 "And here ↓ "
  "[ -r ~/.local/bin/cur_theme ] && . ~/.local/bin/cur_theme" || exit   <-  THIS LINE!!!
  The exit CMD at the EotL is to exit the script(s) if "cur_theme" isn't found or isn't readable.
  This is to avoid bugging dwm's bar when running dwmblocks if there's no color values to be displayed.

IF YOU WANT TO USE A DIFFERENT NAME FOR THE SYMLINK:
You can :D but you'll have to edit all of the previously mentioned scripts D: to match that particular name
instead of "cur_theme" or else the scripts WILL NOT RUN!!!

WHY ALL OF THIS?:
I do this to easily change the themes of all scripts by only deleting the current symlink
and creating another one with the same name pointing to a different theme in "bar_themes/".

Symlink and CMD e.g:
  " ln -s bar_themes/nord cur_theme " <- This CMD will give you a symlink that points to -> "bar_themes/nord".
